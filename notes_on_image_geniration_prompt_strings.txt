After finding that just actions in a row resulted in blending.
I found that useing artist language in prompt string worked much better.
An example;
{background;calm ocean}{midground;beach,rocks,trees,sand}{forground;person holding a fancy tropical drink}

Artists use a variety of terms to describe different areas of an image. Here are some commonly used terms:

Background: The area or space that appears farthest from the viewer, typically behind the main subjects or objects in the image.

Foreground: The area or space that appears closest to the viewer, usually in front of the main subjects or objects.

Midground: The area or space that lies between the background and foreground, creating a sense of depth and perspective.

Focal point: The main point of interest in the image, where the viewer's attention is drawn.

Composition: The arrangement and placement of elements within the image, including the balance, framing, and overall visual structure.

Negative space: The empty or unoccupied areas surrounding the main subjects or objects, which can enhance the focus and impact of the image.

Lighting: The way light is depicted or used within the image, including the direction, intensity, and quality of light sources.

Texture: The visual or tactile quality of surfaces depicted in the image, ranging from smooth and glossy to rough and gritty.

Color palette: The range and combination of colors used in the image, including their hues, saturation, and overall harmony.

Perspective: The way objects and elements are represented in terms of size, scale, and spatial relationships to create a sense of depth and realism.
